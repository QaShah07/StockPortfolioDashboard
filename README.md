## Tech Stack and Technology Used

- Java
- Spring Framework
- Spring Boot
- React
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- MySQL (DataBase)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Maven
- TailwindCSS
- Bootstrap

## Features

- Portfolio Management: Users can view and manage their stock portfolio.
- Top Stocks: Displays the top stocks based on market performance.
- User Can add new Stock 
- User can add and delete according to gain and loss of stock

## Limitatios
1. **API Rate Limits:**
    - The Tiingo API enforces strict rate limits. If more than 10 requests  a 429 Too Many Requests error is triggered.
    - To avoid this, the application makes Tiingo API calls every 6 hours. Consequently, the stock data updates in real-time on the frontend but only reflect the latest data every 6 hours.
2. **Top 50 Stocks Data:**
    - The Tiingo API does not provide data for the ‚ÄúTop 50 Stocks‚Äù directly. Therefore, these stocks have been manually added to the application for display.

## Future Improvements
1. **Paid API Integration:**
   - Upgrading to a paid tier of the  API or an alternative stock market API will allow for higher rate limits and more frequent updates, enhancing the real-time tracking experience.

2. **AI-Powered Features:**
   - Incorporate AI to answer stock-related questions using **sentiment analysis** to evaluate market trends.  
     - [Reference: Sentiment Analysis Google Colab File](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Vlsarlmzuad2ghsyMM7ztyCpU7tN4l96?usp=sharing)
   - Implement **algorithmic trading** concepts to provide intelligent stock suggestions, helping users make informed decisions based on market analysis and trends.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following installed on your local machine:

- JDK 17+
- Maven 3+


This will get a copy of the project installed locally. To configure all of its dependencies and start each app, follow the instructions below.
# backed setup on local machine

# 1.**Configure Database**
1.***Set Username and Password***
- By default, the username and password for MySQL are root.
- If you‚Äôve changed them, update the backend configuration file accordingly.
2.***Update application.properties***
Navigate to src/main/resources/application.properties and configure the database details:
```
server.port=8080

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/stock_portfolio
spring.datasource.username=Your_Username
spring.datasource.password=Your_Password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect

# Tiingo API Configuration
tiingo.api.key=Your_API_Key
tiingo.api.url=https://api.tiingo.com/tiingo/daily/%s/prices?token=%s

# Configure ObjectMapper for Jackson
spring.jackson.property-naming-strategy=SNAKE_CASE
spring.jackson.deserialization.fail-on-unknown-properties=false
```
Replace:
- Your_Username with your MySQL username.
- Your_Password with your MySQL password.
- Your_API_Key with the API key for Tiingo if required.
# 2.**Steps for Create database**
step:1 ***Create the database:***
CREATE DATABASE stock_portfolio;

step:2 ***Switch to the database:***
USE stock_portfolio;

step:3 ***checking existing data***
Use a SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench) or the MySQL command line to verify the schema and data.
3.  **setup in intelliJ IDE**
Follow these steps to set up the backend in IntelliJ IDEA:
#### option1: Use the Terminal
	1.	Open the terminal in IntelliJ IDEA.
    2.	Run the Spring Boot application using Maven Wrapper:
```
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### Option 2: Use the Maven Lifecycle in IntelliJ IDEA
    1.	Open the Maven tab in IntelliJ IDEA.
	2.	Navigate to the Lifecycle section.
	3.	Perform the following steps:
        - Clean: Click on clean to remove old build files.
        - nstall: Click on install to build the project and install dependencies.
    4. Run the application:
        - Expand the Plugins section in the Maven tab and find spring-boot.
        - Click on spring-boot:run to start the backend.
4.   Verify the Setup
	1.	Ensure the backend is running on http://localhost:8080.

# Frontend Setup on Local Machine

Step 1: Install Dependencies
```
    #Navigate to the frontend directory in your terminal:
    
    cd <frontend-folder>
    
    #Run the following command to install all dependencies listed in the package.json file:
    
    npm install
```
Step 2: Run the Development Server
```
    #Start the development server using the following command:
    npm run dev
```
    This will:
    - Start the React development server. 
    - Serve the frontend application at http://localhost:5173 (default for Vite)
